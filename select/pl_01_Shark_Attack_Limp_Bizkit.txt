Another one of those days
Feelin like a shovel
With a lot of shit in the way
Gonna clear me a path
Right to the culprit
Straight to your fucked up ass
This ain't about rage
It's about disrespect
You should've thought about that (punk)
Before your trap went flap
Homie what the deal
Why you talkin shit like that (why)
I've had enough drama
I don't need a chump
Talkin that trash in pajamas
Heated up like a sauna
Time to pay the piper
I ain't givin hope like Obama (nope)
I'm spittin out flames
Better hit he deck
I'm a mic check them games (yeah)
You don't need a new coach
You need a new neck
Once I connect with your throat
Still shockin like a heart attack
Cuz I'm a maniac (cuz I'm a maniac)
Still runnin through the shark attack
Without a single scratch
(without a single scratch)
Still livin where the dark is at
Up in my braniac (up in my braniac)
Still bitin while you're barkin back
So you can shut your trap
Check one two
I ain't even through
Givin you grief
Put another stain on your teeth (yeah)
Back up on your feet
Call in the rescue
Better get the whole damn fleet (damn fleet)
This attack ain't stealth
It's worldwide homicide
Bad for your health (what)
I'm going straight for your gut
Closing them eyes
Sewin them lids straight shut (blind)
Go ahead put it on me
Show me what you got
While you get robbed like a zombie
It's the one man army
Puff puff give
Watch'em get smoked like a cig (smoked)
You hear of Freddy Krueger
I'm kinda like that
With a red cap and a rueger (punk)
Still slingin it to ya
Microphone hustler
Bad mother fucker... screw ya
Still shockin like a heart attack
Cuz I'm a maniac (cuz I'm a maniac)
Still runnin through the shark attack
Without a single scratch
(without a single scratch)
Still livin where the dark is at
Up in my braniac (up in my braniac)
Still bitin while you're barkin back
So you can shut your trap
Shut it down... shut it down...
Swimming with... sharks ain't easy
They just want... to kill and eat me
I ain't gonna... let that happen
Watch me plan... my shark attack and
Make them wish... they never knew me
Turn their great... white ass to sushi
This is my... old school technique
It's all I need... to leave in one piece (yeah)
Still shockin like a heart attack
Cuz I'm a maniac (cuz I'm a maniac)
Still runnin through the shark attack
Without a single scratch
(without a single scratch)
Still livin where the dark is at
Up in my braniac (up in my braniac)
Still bitin while you're barkin back
So you can shut your trap
Shut it down... Shut it down
